The first process that runs is in the RUNNING STATE which is using the CPU, while the other processes are in the READTY state until the first process gets finished. When the first process is finished, the second process begins to RUN. There is an overlapping state between the process 1\u2019s DONE state and the process 2\u2019s RUN state. On the other hand, since the process is I/O bound it spends the time WAITING. Therefore, while the CPU-bound process is executing first, the I/O bound is waiting.",

Instead, it orders lock acquisition based on the memory addresses of the vectors. This allows different threads to work on different vectors concurrently, as long as they\u2019re not trying to lock the same two vectors in the opposite order. Therefore, the global order approach is likely to have better performance than the avoid-hold-and-wait approach, both with and without parallelism enabled. `./vector-global-order -d n 2 -l 800000 -t`: 0.30 seconds `./vector-avoid-hold-and-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -t`: 0.76 seconds `./vector-global-order -d n 2 -l 800000 -p -t`: 0.14 seconds `./vector-avoid-hold-and-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -p -t`: 0.38 seconds The test results prove my hypothesis. Compare to vector-try-wait.c: The try-wait approach uses `pthread_mutex_trylock()` to attempt to lock the vectors without blocking. If it can\u2019t acquire a lock, it immediately releases any locks it already holds and tries again. This approach can also provide more concurrency than the avoid-hold-and-wait approach because it doesn\u2019t use a global lock. However, it could lead to busy-waiting if a thread repeatedly fails to acquire its locks, which could consume CPU resources. `./vector-try-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -t`: 1.22 seconds `./vector-avoid-hold-and-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -t`: 0.76 seconds `./vector-try-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -p -t`: 0.18 seconds `./vector-avoid-hold-and-wait -d n 2 -l 800000 -p -t`: 0.38 seconds The test results prove my hypothesis.",

After that the consumer will sleep for 1s and the producer will produce until the buffer is full, and when it is full it will wait for the consumer to wake up and continue consuming. Num_full will be switching from buffer_size-1 and buffer_size, because producer is producing faster than consumer consuming.",

It is because the sleep string let the consumer to sleep for 1 second at c6 while c6 is to release the mutex lock.

Start with a buffer (size 1), and then increase it. How does the behavior of the code change with larger buffers? (or does it?) What would you predict num_full to be with different buffer sizes (e.g., -m 10) and different numbers of produced items (e.g., -l 100), when you change the consumer sleep string from default (no sleep) to -C 0,0,0,0,0,0,1?",
      "instructor_answer": "With larger buffers, producer can add multiple values to the buffer (up to the length of the buffer) before it waits or context switches, and vice versa for the consumer. The second question models consumers that take much longer to consume items than it takes for producers to produce items. The consumer grabs one item each and then immediately falls asleep for one second, leaving the producer to fill the buffer. The producer would then sleep until the consumer woke up and cycle repeated. (Help to understand the second question model) The buffer would thus spend most of its time full, i.e. num_full would always be equal to or close to the buffer size.

      "student_answer": "When the buffer is larger or more numbers of produced items, the num_full is always 0 or 1, which the number of entries in the buffer is either 0 or 1. It is because there is only 1 producer and 1 consumer, it is always that the producer produces an item, then the consumer consumes it. So larger the buffer will not change the behavior and having different numbers of produced items will not change the pattern that the producer produces an item, then the consumer consumes it. When I change the consumer sleep string to the specified one, the behavior of the code also does not change. It is because the sleep string let the consumer to sleep for 1 second at c6 while c6 is to release the mutex lock. After releasing the lock, the consumer will not run immediately as the producer will get the lock and lock the critical section, so having a sleep at c6 will not affect the code behavior.",
