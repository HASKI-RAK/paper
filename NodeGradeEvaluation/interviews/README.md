# Contextual information for the student interviews

This repository contains transcripts from interviews conducted simultaneously with student pairs. The interviews were part of a broader study on [HASKI](https://github.com/HASKI-RAK) (an adaptive learning system). To preserve the integrity and authenticity of the original conversations, the transcripts are provided in German. Because they reflect primarily verbal communication, they may not always follow standard written grammar perfectly.

Please note that these interviews covered various topics. Sections marked with “(...)” indicate content not relevant to [NodeGrade](https://github.com/HASKI-RAK/NodeGrade) (the focus of this paper) and have been omitted here.
